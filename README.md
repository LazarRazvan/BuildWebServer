# Projects builder (Docker)

## The purpose of this project is to get used with Docker.

This is Docker based project designed for building large projects
and keeping a history of all the builds.

This projects is based on 6 services :
```
	- webserver
	- influxdb
	- grafana
	- gcc-builder
	- clang-builder
	- parser
```
## Web server

It consists of a frontend and a backend written in flash.
It communicates with InfluxDB service to store authentication information
and allow uploading of zip archives, specifying which compiler would users
like to use to build their projects.

The archives should contain the Makefile to build the sources.

Requirements:
```
	- python3
	- flask
	- influxdb
```
Use the following link in order to install and get used with IndluxDB:

## InfluxDB

Service based on InfluxDB is used to store authentication information and
build results for each user, that are displayed in Grafana.

## Grafana

Connected to InfluxDB to display a dashboard containing build information.

## Builders

Two containers based on gcc and clang compilers that polls the files uploaded
on the webserver, unzip, build the project and create a log file that will
end up being processed by the parser service.

Docker images for gcc/clang environment:
```
	docker pull gcc
	docker pull rsmmr/clang	
```
## Parser

Poll the result files generated by builders, inspect the content and add the data
to InfluxDB.
